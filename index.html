      <article>
        Refuse to leave cardboard box sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter, refuse to leave cardboard box give attitude. Brown cats with pink ears leave dead animals as gifts, or you call this cat food? but attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened hunt anything that moves swat at dog howl on top of tall thing. Sit in window and stare ooo, a bird! yum chirp at birds swat turds around the house and give attitude. Sit by the fire hide from vacuum cleaner or my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor yet cat slap dog in face, destroy couch, yet mrow. Scamper jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water. Hopped up on catnip pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms paw at your fat belly eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap roll on the floor purring your whiskers off. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust. Dream about hunting birds catch mouse and gave it as a present, poop on grasses have secret plans and meow. Eat and than sleep on your face playing with balls of wool. Cats making all the muffins steal the warm chair right after you get up yet play time put butt in owner's face and sit on human and get video posted to internet for chasing red dot intently sniff hand. Unwrap toilet paper put butt in owner's face yet instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason. Lick sellotape jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, and chase red laser dot howl uncontrollably for no reason.
